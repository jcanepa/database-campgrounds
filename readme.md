# NPS Campgrounds Relational Model

## How to run this project

MySQL database configuration is managed in `config.php`. Connect to a database with your connection details.

From the `/sql` directory,
1. Run schema to create relational tables
2. Run insert statments to seed database with values
3. Experiment running sample queries or the more interesting transactional queries

Serve up php in your browser to run the project locally. It can be installed with [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) on a mac, version 8 is good. We will also use [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/) as our package manager and `mysql` for the database, `mariadb` is even better.

This project uses `php8`, `composer`, [`vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
